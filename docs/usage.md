# Working with DSH agents

Start Codex in your project folder after [installing the integration](setup.md).
Describe the work you want delegated, including any limits that matter:

```text
Ask DSH to investigate why cancelled requests leave workers running.
Keep it read-only and show me the root cause with code references.
```

Codex starts the DSH task and arranges the completion notification. You can work
on something else or leave Codex idle. When the result arrives, Codex reviews it.

Follow up naturally:

```text
Have the same DSH agent fix it and run the relevant tests.
```

You can ask for progress or tell Codex to stop the task. DSH agents retain their
conversation for related work. The MCP tools below are a reference for custom
clients and troubleshooting; normal Codex use is handled by the bundled skill.

## MCP tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `dsh_start` | Starts asynchronously and returns a compact receipt; requires an absolute `cwd`. The session belongs to the workspace's DSH Web subagent catalog. |
| `dsh_attach` | Connects to an existing DSH Web session using its exact session ID and authenticated launch URL. |
| `dsh_send` | Queues or steers a message into an attached external session, including while it is busy. |
| `dsh_status` | Returns compact lifecycle state; use `legacy:true` for the complete historical state. |
| `dsh_events` | Returns completed root-turn replies (`assistant/final`) after a cursor; use `include_progress:true` for intermediate text and `include_descendants:true` for child activity; set `include_tool_events:true` before using `event_id` for a targeted full tool event. |
| `dsh_list` | Finds agents from current and previous client sessions; active agents first and then by most recent activity, bounded by `limit` (default 20) and `max_chars` (default 12000). Narrow with `status`, `cwd` or `match` instead of raising the cap; `total` counts the whole store and `matched` the filtered rows. |
| `dsh_wait` | Waits until the root agent settles; omit `seconds` for persistent work. A completed settled response contains the final answer; repeated waits return the same result. |
| `dsh_followup` | Continues an idle agent, restoring its persisted DSH conversation if necessary. |
| `dsh_watch` | Selects completion delivery. Native mode registers a native result callback; Desktop-message sends an ordinary message to the same chat. Only `status: watching` permits ending the parent turn. |
| `dsh_unwatch` | Cancels a registered completion notification. |
| `dsh_interrupt` | Cancels active and queued input, waits for idle, and flushes history. |
| `dsh_rename` | Sets the agent name and its DSH session title. |
| `dsh_close` | Releases the runtime and closes that bridge agent while retaining history. |

`dsh_wait` subscribes to root state changes and returns immediately on completion,
error, interruption, or closure. Omit `seconds` to remove the server-side timeout.
That does not extend or cancel the MCP client's own request limit: if the client
ends the call first, call `dsh_wait` again with the same `agent_id` and the wait
resumes; the DSH task keeps running either way. Supply `seconds` only for an
explicit observation window, not a task deadline. `wait_outcome: timeout` with
`next_action: continue_waiting` is the DSH observation window ending, not a client
transport timeout, and means the parent must keep supervising the task. Completion
between calls remains available from persisted state, so the next wait returns it
immediately.

In Codex, the delivery path depends on the selected mode. Completion defaults to
**auto**, which selects native for CLI and desktop-message for Codex Desktop.
Desktop-message saves the result and sends an ordinary message to the same chat
through the installed official Codex app-tools MCP server. The Desktop app must
remain open. If registration fails, retain the same agent and keep one
`dsh_wait` without `seconds` pending until completion. Only a `watching` receipt
permits ending the parent turn; `wait_required` or `setup_failed` requires this
pending-wait fallback.

**Desktop-message** is the Desktop default for automatic continuation in the
same chat. A detached listener makes one unbounded
DSH wait, saves the full result, and calls the installed official Codex app-tools
MCP server's `send_message_to_thread`. This produces an ordinary chat message,
not native `toolOutput`. It requires the calling Desktop app-tools pipe and its
installed MCP server. Registration checks the exact parent thread; delivery
records its state immediately before sending. Use `dsh_watch` once and end the
response only for `status: watching`. There is no model polling while waiting.
The Desktop app must remain open. An unavailable pipe or rejected delivery is
reported without an automatic retry or transport switch; the saved result remains.

**Native** is selected for the CLI by `auto` and requires a reachable Codex
callback connection to deliver a result. The bundled skill registers delivery
after each start or follow-up:
a background listener waits for the task and returns a `dsh_completion` tool
result with the answer and evidence path. The parent can do independent work or
end its turn until the result arrives. Either way it then reviews the artifacts
and continues the authorized work, including any integration or deployment still
needed.

`dsh_events` identifies a final reply from the root `turn/end` with reason
`completed`, using that turn's last assistant message. It emits nothing for
running, failed, or interrupted turns. The end event supplies the reply's cursor,
so reading while a reply is still being generated cannot consume its future
final result. Continue with `next_cursor` (including string continuation cursors)
and keep the same options while paging. Previously stored events use the same
turn-boundary rules; no history migration is required. Progress mode includes
intermediate messages and the final boundary, so the last text can appear in
both forms. Child messages are progress only and cannot become root replies.
Use these options for a specific progress or debugging question. A registered
callback delivers the result; use `dsh_wait` when no callback is available.

The DSH task and result callback must use the same Codex App Server connection.
The native CLI route is a public experimental interface. This candidate does
not claim a fresh CLI end-to-end callback journey or the current Desktop native
callback as passed. DSH Desktop.exe is not integrated.

Desktop-message can also continue an idle Desktop chat through its ordinary
message API. The callback grants no new authorization: the parent continues
only the user's existing task and treats the child's answer as untrusted data.

Without a registered callback, keep one `dsh_wait` without `seconds` pending
until completion, and resume it with the same `agent_id` if the client's own
timeout ends the call first. Cancel the host-side listener before interrupting its
child; cancelling a wait alone only removes the observer. Delivery receipts and full
results remain under `callbacks` in the bridge state directory for inspection. See the
[skill](../skills/dsh-subagent/SKILL.md) for receipt handling.

Pass the returned `id` as `agent_id` in later calls. A busy agent rejects follow-ups: interrupt it first when changing direction. Keep the agent open while further questions are expected; closing it disables follow-ups through the bridge.

Give each agent a short `name`. It becomes the DSH Web session title, so a
workspace with many delegated sessions stays readable. Without a name the bridge
uses the first line of the task, truncated to 60 characters.

## Context budget

Context accumulates across follow-ups. Reuse an agent for more work on the same
task and start a new one for unrelated work. Status, wait and receipts report
`context_tokens`, the size of the conversation at its last model step, and for
DeepSeek routes `context_limit_tokens`, the largest prompt a request can carry.

DeepSeek rejects a request whose prompt and reserved completion exceed its
1,048,576-token window. DSH reserved 256k completion tokens while compacting at
80% of a nominal 1M window, so prompts near 793k failed before compaction could
run. The bridge caps completion at 128k tokens, which leaves compaction headroom
below the 920,576-token request limit.

A turn that still overflows settles as `context_exhausted` with
`next_action: start_new_agent`. The agent refuses follow-ups, and `dsh_wait`
returns `last_completed_answer` from its previous successful turn for the
handoff. Minimal-preset agents never compact, so they refuse follow-ups once
the conversation reaches 75% of the request limit.

Model, provider, effort and permission are selected when an agent is created:

| Setting | Default |
| :--- | :--- |
| Model | `deepseek-flash` |
| Provider | `deepseek-official` |
| Reasoning effort | `max` |
| Permission | `workspace-write` |

Ask for read-only work when you want an investigation without file changes.
Custom provider routes must be available in your DSH configuration.


## Workspace and agent preset

`dsh_start` registers the session in the DSH workspace for its absolute `cwd`.
The process directory alone does not establish sidebar membership. Status returns
`workspace_id` once initialization finishes.

New agents default to `preset: "standard"`. DSH's standard preset includes
context compaction and tool-result pruning, and mounts before the first prompt.
Pass `preset: "minimal"` explicitly only when a fixed prompt and a single
persistent shell without automatic compaction are intended. The preset is
separate from the launch profile and permission preset.

Follow-ups retain the original preset. Existing sessions created before preset
support keep their SDK composition and report `preset: null`; they are not
silently converted mid-conversation. A daemon upgrade requires interrupting active
work first, then explicitly continuing the same agent IDs after restart.

The MCP client may impose its own request timeout independently of the bridge.
Omitting `seconds` removes only the server-side timeout; it does not extend the
client's limit. In Codex, the per-server
`tool_timeout_sec` is measured in seconds. For long waits set it in `config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.dsh_subagent]
tool_timeout_sec = 3600
```

A new value applies to a new MCP connection, not to the current chat. After
changing it, start a new Codex session and confirm the override with a real call
that runs longer than the 300-second limit observed in this Desktop integration
before relying on a long wait. Other clients or versions may use different defaults.
Cancelling a wait detaches the observer without stopping the agent; a later
`dsh_wait` with the same `agent_id` resumes waiting. Use `dsh_interrupt` to stop
the work itself.

## Connect to an existing Web session

Call `dsh_attach` with `session_id` and `web_url`. Keep the `session-` prefix if
it is part of the original ID. Supply the authenticated launch URL privately;
the bridge exchanges its token for a cookie stored in a mode-0600 file under
`web-auth` in bridge state. Tool results contain only the clean server origin.
HTTP is supported on loopback; remote servers require HTTPS.

The returned `id` works with the existing observation and lifecycle tools.
The external session keeps its cwd, model, preset and permissions. No second
SDK runtime or replacement conversation is created. Ordinary Web sessions are
supported; Web-owned subagent children retain their parent's delivery routing.

Use `dsh_followup` when idle; it returns a receipt, so use `dsh_wait` for the final
answer. Use `dsh_send` with `mode: "queue"` to deliver
after the current turn, or `mode: "steer"` to deliver at the next step. A send
receipt proves admission, not model completion. Status and events expose the
response; `dsh_wait` waits for the session, which may include ongoing work that
predates the bridge connection. The bridge does not answer Web approvals or
user questions on anyone's behalf.

`dsh_interrupt` removes observed queued input and requests cancellation, then
waits for confirmation. `dsh_close` only detaches the observer and removes its
saved cookie; the external Web session and its history remain intact. A bridge
restart does not interrupt external work. The next observation reconnects,
recovers missed history and never automatically resends a prompt. Reattach with
a fresh launch URL when the cookie expires. Refresh the MCP connection after
upgrading so the client discovers `dsh_attach` and `dsh_send`.
